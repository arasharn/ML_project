We utilize Bayesian inference to estimate parameters from samples obtained from a parametrized physics-based model. Sampling methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Sequential Monte Carlo are commonly employed to investigate the posterior distribution. These approaches frequently necessitate substantial numbers of iterations until convergence. We extend the previous research on Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (cWGANs) by applying them to nondeterministic models. We employ the full gradient penalty method to encourage Lipschitz continuity, a required property for the critic to be a Wasserstein distance. We modify the generator and critic networks to accommodate data from physics-based models. The cWGAN framework operates on the joint probability space of parameters and observational samples. This allows the model to capture the complex dependencies between the parameters of the model and the observed data. The conditional probability of the Bayesian inverse problem is then extracted from the joint probability. We conduct numerical tests to assess the efficacy of our method using benchmark one-dimensional distributions. We illustrate the difficulties related to the training and convergence of the model, highlighting the iterative procedure required to achieve precise estimates of parameter posteriors from observational samples.
